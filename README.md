To whoever is reading this from my job applications: this is a VERY basic representation of what I can do. Most of my serious projects are confidential.
The purpose of this github is to show that I am not some random person who doesn't even understand what I am doing.
Please schedule an interview to get a deeper grasp of my knowledge.

Thanks,
Malachi
